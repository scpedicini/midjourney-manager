# midjourney-manager

Tools related to managing MJ (aggregating images, tagging, bulk downloading, etc)


# To Do

- [ ] Add a `--dry-run` option to `mj-download` to just print the URLs that would be downloaded
- [ ] Create a bundled executable for `mj-download` for releases
- [ ] Migrate away from using Image Magick for `mj-download` (it's a huge dependency)
